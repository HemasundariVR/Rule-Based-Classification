#### Description :
Rule-based classification is a classification technique that falls under the umbrella of machine learning, particularly in the context of supervised machine learning. It involves creating decision rules based on certain conditions or criteria to classify data into different predefined categories or classes. This approach is often intuitive and interpretable, as it directly translates human expertise or domain knowledge into a set of rules for classifying instances.

Initially I scraped the data from (Coursera.org) for performing Rule-Based classification. Then, I framed 16 rules based on my knowledge and Web. These rules divides the courses in 17 categories (16 framed + others). Finally, I visualized the distribution of courses with the help of Pie chart and Bar Chart.
